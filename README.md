# VIVO Testing

Build and test new install procedures for VIVO using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) that will:

1. Simplify the creation of a development environment for VIVO, Vitro and the ontology.  Create a one button install 
ready for coding in [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
1. Improve the ability to manage dependencies

By simplifying the creation of the development environment, encourage broader community involvement in the 
development of the application and ontology.
